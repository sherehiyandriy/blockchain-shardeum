# Formatting
- Uses google typescript prettier settings for the most part.
- `/*prettier-ignore*/` is often used to bypass really long debug code lines, this is a tip, not an instruction.
- Do not abuse `/*prettier-ignore*/`.

## Using `/* prettier-ignore */`

### What is `/* prettier-ignore */`?

`/* prettier-ignore */` is a directive used in Prettier to prevent the code formatter from formatting a specific piece of code. This can be useful when you have lines of code that should remain unchanged for readability, debugging, or other specific reasons.

### When to Use `/* prettier-ignore */`

There are a few common scenarios where you might want to use `/* prettier-ignore */`:

1. **Long Debug Lines**: When you have long lines of code for debugging purposes that you want to keep on a single line for easier readability.
2. **Special Formatting**: When you have specific formatting that you want to maintain that Prettier would otherwise change.
3. **Temporary Code**: When you have temporary code that is meant for testing and you donâ€™t want it to be auto-formatted.

### How to Use `/* prettier-ignore */`

To use `/* prettier-ignore */`, simply place the comment on the line before the code you want to ignore. Here is an example:

#### Example

```javascript
/* prettier-ignore */
if (ShardeumFlags.VerboseLogs) console.log('Lengths of blocks after pruning', Object.keys(blocksByHash).length, Object.keys(readableBlocks).length)
```
